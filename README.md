# Information Techonologie of the Web Project RIA

This project consists on creating a web application from scratch, implementing an e-commerce website.

The initial phases focused on creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, implementing it in a MySQL database, and setting up an Apache Tomcat server to host the application.

Following this, I implemented the back-end using Java and the front-end with HTML and CSS.

This implementation include the Rich Internet Application (RIA) version of the application that uses JavaScript to enhance the user experience.
